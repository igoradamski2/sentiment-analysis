       " '0:::a recently uncovered one fourth of orson welle s planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named it s all true this short dealt with welle s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle s attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson u s a 1928 director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on w somerset maugham s story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra s lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the lastminutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen little awkwardness and a very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie s soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maugham s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for still it s entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymore s incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is a better word it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not a tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesn t it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night some gore don t bring children to this one don t bring adults to this one unless they re fascinated by puppetry and or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped blech this film takes us back and forth over the east german west german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany after a round the world trip his boss think s he s on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work while everyone think s he s still living in east germany of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting still a good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny after a lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival i ve learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to 1 be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis 2 ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait 3 any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching 4 when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossible witness malcolm last year task well i ignored rules last night and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards it s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 s about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor s daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a window between them while it s raining you d think a woman studying medicine would know better the photography is good but i kept wishing for b w everything seems sepia colored anyway actually i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead but that s life grade z avoid like the plague unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks',\n",
       " '0:::the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence visually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver s travels and treat it as an action film that makes it a film without much center pierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes a k a monkey planet the novel as a social satire it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver s travels humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnms the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps i was just looking for that when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 he added a number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish the final irony of the original version has become film history without it there could never have been a planet of the apes film series i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language that could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending but serling never tackles the all important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language a language they had no opportunity to ever hear few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith s best if not his best when the film s success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book burton s new version is even less faithful first he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes he has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes that could be a good story too but it is not planet of the apes as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring in 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this world s most expressive actor works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect he quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks and the language they talk is earth english apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power she is bent on making the world a better place perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil ari in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes this is a further abandonment of the source material the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each s place in this reversed society each important in the book we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn this is a miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win the 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like i never met an ape i didn t like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog this tends to limit close looks at the makeup in general it seems much improved from 1968 the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the 1968 version in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw dropper it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion chambers is good but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker today audiences have higher expectations baker s visualization is really an improvement these visuals work nicely what does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make they look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close up since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make up the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti it is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes but he delivers them very well he was always a watchable actor but has not yet made stardom as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up but does it very well in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov s performance in spartacus as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself danny elfman s score has a nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmith s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten',\n",

       " '1:::final fantasy the spirits within with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft s square pictures final fantasy inspired by the top selling game franchise is visually awe inspiring and groundbreaking no doubt you have never seen anything like this film and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting obviously the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects overall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they don t sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling but you won t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow like the series of games final fantasy s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi it s the year 2065 and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien phantoms whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors the often invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein james woods to blast the aliens with a zeus cannon dr aki ross ming na and dr sid donald sutherland plan to build a wave using eight collected spirits to counteract the phantoms and kill them off while the images serve the sci fi aspect of the film well the storytelling doesn t it s unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english except two americans wrote the screenplay nevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes why do these aliens feed on souls if they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them with guns what is so special about the spirits that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens worse yet the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science heavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or a sappy love story depending on who s doing the talking for the most part it s bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments but when the lights come up and the credits roll you re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked there s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film you d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more',\n",

       " '1:::starring sylvester stallone amy brenneman viggo mortensen dan hedaya jay o sanders at first glance daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie on second glance it looks that way too although as typical disaster movies go daylight isn t that bad admittedly it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by think poseidon adventure but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the haven t i seen this scene somewhere before feeling that creeps up all too often during the film sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york s emergency response team by sheer luck he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film what disaster is that you ask as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat glad you asked through a whole sequence of entirely probable events about as probable as hitting the lottery a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends which causes not only massive loss of life but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel good old sly who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses offers his services to the rescuers who gladly accept it sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft think judge dredd which he can only go in and not out off and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside so begins the fun but the fun has to be quick because this tunnel has started to spring a leak the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie not superb by any means but far above some of his other films think judge dredd again daylight s acting is probably average or a little above in terms of this sort of genre starring this particular star amy brenneman is the only actor of any note and she does a pretty good job as stallone s reluctant helper oh yeah stallone s real life son sage is in this too sage nice name i guess it could be worse he could have been named nutmeg or parsley note to sage you are still young go to school and get a good education you don t have a future in acting the plot runs along the same lines as the acting interesting but predictable mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle another one seems to pop right up even worse than the last one i realize that it wouldn t be much of a movie otherwise but it does make the movie a bit predictable adding to the predictability is the cast of characters which of course has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy in this case stallone doesn t know what he is doing why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together would this be too much to ask can t we all just get along special effects weren t bad but i ve certainly seen better some of the scenes while fun to watch were such blatant rip offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater the tunnel of course starts to flood i really expected gene hackman roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute i wasn t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas the poseidon adventure is a good one to use the underwater sequences aside from the deja vu were very well shot and worked fairly well they were the best part of the movie by a long shot better than average stallone flick i realize that s not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger daylight is a fun movie and as long as you aren t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised']"
